# sis-project
The SIS (Simple Inventory System) project is a small scale inventory system for an item storage room, with a "library" style management (leasing out items to others).
### Motivation
This project was created and is being worked on by [Lidia Vasileva](https://github.com/lydiavasileva).
This project is being made as part of my job as a Student Helper at Lillebælt Academy, University of Applied Science and their IT Inventory, during my studies within the specialty of IT Technology with a focus on Networks.

This system is being created for Lillebælt Academy, University of Applied Science and their IT Inventory. This inventory includes only hardware pieces - Raspberry Pies, Monitors, Cables, etc. 

This project was created due to a lack of known software solutions to be used in such a simple inventory.
Important reason is also the experience which a project like this could provide an IT student, including working with Databases, Coding languages, Security of Data and more.
